## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. Bauhaus is minimalistic design
2. Swiss Style uses grids 
3. New Wave Typography is the opposite of Swiss style

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. First time ever hearing about this designs
2.
3.

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.

[1 Functionalism — Design prioritizing utility and purpose over decoration. (Bauhaus, Swiss Style)
2 Form Follows Function — Aesthetic decisions derive directly from functional requirements. (Bauhaus)
3 Asymmetrical Composition — Balanced layout without mirrored symmetry. (Bauhaus, Swiss Style)
4 Sans-Serif Typography — Typefaces without serifs emphasizing clarity and modernity. (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, New Wave, Grunge)
5 Geometric Abstraction — Use of simplified geometric forms to structure composition. (Bauhaus)
6 Grid System — Structured framework organizing elements into aligned columns and modules. (Swiss Style, New Wave)
7 Modular Layout — Design organized into repeatable proportionally consistent units. (Swiss Style)
8 Objective Typography — Neutral typographic communication avoiding personal expression. (Swiss Style)
9 Typographic Hierarchy — Visual organization of text to signal importance and structure. (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, New Wave, Grunge)
10 Universality — Design aimed at cross-cultural language-neutral communication. (Swiss Style)
11 Constructivist Influence — Adoption of dynamic diagonals and industrial aesthetics. (Bauhaus)
12 Photomontage — Composite imagery formed by combining photographic fragments. (Bauhaus)
13 Baseline Shift — Intentional vertical displacement of text from standard alignment. (New Wave)
14 Typographic Layering — Overlapping text elements to create depth and complexity. (New Wave, Grunge)
15 Grid Deconstruction — Deliberate disruption of traditional grid alignment. (New Wave)
16 Expressive Typography — Typography used as a primary visual and emotional device. (New Wave, Grunge)
17 Vernacular Typography — Incorporation of informal or non-standard typographic references. (Grunge)
18 Distressed Type — Digitally altered type simulating wear or erosion. (Grunge)
19 Legibility vs. Readability — Distinction between letter recognition and text comprehension. (All three)
20 Typographic Experimentation — Systematic exploration of unconventional composition techniques. (New Wave, Grunge)]

Pin the distinctions that surprised you or corrected you.

[1 Bauhaus vs. Art Deco
Common confusion: Both use geometric forms and emerged in the early 20th century, so they are often grouped together.
Difference: Bauhaus is functional, industrial, and anti-ornament, while Art Deco is decorative, luxurious, and symmetrical. If the design feels glamorous and stylized, it is likely Art Deco; if it feels utilitarian and stripped down, it is Bauhaus.

2 Swiss Style vs. Minimalism
Common confusion: Both use clean layouts, limited color, and significant white space.
Difference: Swiss Style depends on strict grid systems, typographic hierarchy, and objective communication, while Minimalism is a broader aesthetic reduction that may not rely on grids or typographic structure. Swiss is systematic and typographic; Minimalism can be conceptual or atmospheric.

3 New Wave vs. Grunge Typography
Common confusion: Both reject Swiss rigidity and break traditional grid structures.
Difference: New Wave manipulates typography through controlled experimentation like baseline shifts and layering, while Grunge embraces distressed textures, irregularity, and reduced legibility. New Wave challenges structure intellectually; Grunge disrupts it visually and emotionally.

4 Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus
Common confusion: Swiss Style is often seen as identical to Bauhaus modernism.
Difference: Bauhaus established modernist functional principles across art and design disciplines, while Swiss Style refined those principles into highly structured typographic systems. Bauhaus is foundational modernism; Swiss Style is its systematic typographic evolution.]

## DECISIONS

|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | [New Wave — Because it is realated to Swiss grid design] |
| Expert for critique | [Wolfgang Weingart — I selected him beacause he is regarded as the father of New Wave] |


## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1. The name Bauhaus made me think that it could be an old fahioned design, but it is modern looking.
2. I thought Swiss style and New Typography are the same, but they kind of constradict each other.
