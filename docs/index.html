    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus (1919-1933)</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919-1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Bauhaus organized design as Gesamtkunstwerk: a program linking architecture, craft, and communication. Founded in Weimar in 1919, it shifted toward industrial production and standardization by 1923, moved to Dessau in 1925, and closed in 1933 under political pressure. Its workshop model treated reduction and rationalism as methods, not style effects. Furniture, metalwork, and typography were designed for repeatable use, with modular proportion and functional typography supporting clarity. The movement's influence comes from aligning formal discipline with manufacturing constraints.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950-1970)</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1950-1970</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Swiss Style, also called the International Typographic Style, consolidated after World War II and is often framed as 1950-1970. Its method prioritized the typographic grid, grotesque typeface choices, flush-left rag-right setting, and compositional asymmetry to maximize legibility and readability across languages. Designers in Zurich and Basel pursued universality through reduction, formal discipline, and functional typography, often replacing illustration with photography. This was rationalism in public communication: order, modular proportion, and repeatable systems. By the 1970s and 1980s, this model was challenged by structural experimentation.</p>

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave Typography (Late 1960s-1980s)</h2>
      <p class="date-range">Late 1960s-1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>New Wave Typography emerged as a reaction to Swiss formal discipline in the late 1960s and spread through the 1970s-1980s. Wolfgang Weingart questioned rigid grid rules and pushed structural experimentation that treated type as image, not only text. The result was spatial fragmentation, typographic distortion, and typographic contrast while negotiating legibility and readability. In the United States, April Greiman became a leading figure after relocating to Los Angeles in 1976. This movement did not reject rationalism; it redirected it toward expressive systems with complexity and variable rhythm.</p>
